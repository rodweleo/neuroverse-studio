## Overview

NeuroVerse addresses the centralization problem in AI development by providing a platform where developers and users can create, share, and monetize AI agents without relying on traditional cloud infrastructure. Built on ICP's blockchain technology, it ensures permanent availability, transparent transactions, and true ownership of AI assets.

## Background

Building and deploying AI agents today requires deep technical knowledge, expensive infrastructure, and limited ownership. Most platforms are centralized, restrict extensibility, and don't offer clear monetization for tool developers or contributors. As a result, non-technical users are left out, and developers have no sustainable incentive to build useful AI integrations. That is why Neuroverse was built.  
Neuroverse is a Web3-native, no-code platform that lets anyone create, customize, deploy, and monetize AI agents. All this is powered by the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).  
Neuroverse was inspired by platforms like **_n8n_** and _**Make.com**_, but built entirely on-chain. Neuroverse grants users complete ownership of their agents and offer developers an open marketplace to monetize their tools.

**Who is it for?**

- AI developers seeking to deploy and monetize agents
- Users looking to interact with decentralized AI
- Web3 and blockchain enthusiasts

## Installation

### System Requirements

- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm >= 7.0.0
- [DFX SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- Internet Computer Wallet (Plug, Stoic, etc.)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rodweleo/neuroverse-studio.git
   cd neuroverse-studio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the local ICP replica:**

   ```bash
   dfx start --clean --background
   ```

4. **Deploy the canisters:**

   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

5. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   cd src/neuroverse_frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## Usage

- Access the app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) after running the dev server.
- Register or log in using Internet Identity or Plug Wallet.
- Deploy your own AI agent or interact with agents in the marketplace.
- Manage your agents, earnings, and knowledge base from the dashboard.

### Common Commands

- `npm run dev` – Start the frontend in development mode
- `npm run build` – Build the frontend for production
- `dfx start` – Start the local ICP replica
- `dfx deploy` – Deploy backend and frontend canisters

---

## Configuration

- **Environment Variables:**  
  The project may use a `.env` file for configuration (see `.gitignore` for exclusion).  
  By default, DFX outputs environment variables to `.env` as specified in `dfx.json`.
- **Network Configuration:**
  - Local development uses `regtest` Bitcoin network.
  - Production uses `testnet` (see `src/neuroverse_backend/Main.mo` for details).
- **ICP Canister IDs:**
  - Managed in `canister_ids.json` (auto-generated by DFX).
